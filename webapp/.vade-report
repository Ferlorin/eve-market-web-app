## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed Package:**
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to dependencies
- Used npm (project's package manager)
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json

**2. Modified Files:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout file
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<Providers>` wrapper
  - Preserves all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and styling

### Implementation Details

This is an App Router project (using the `app` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`. The component is placed at the end of the `<body>` tag to ensure it loads after the main application content.

### Verification

✅ Package installed successfully with npm
✅ TypeScript compilation passed (verified during build)
✅ ESLint passed with no errors
✅ Code follows existing project patterns
✅ All changes staged with git

### Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals
- No additional configuration is required - it works out of the box
- The component only sends analytics data when deployed to Vercel
- In development mode, analytics are collected but not sent to avoid affecting production data
